# Audio_Recorder
A Simple Audio Recording Program

This system will need the following Libraries;
- PyAudio
- os
- wave
- shutil
- pydub
- time
- Threading
- Pynput

The program to date is now feeling like a real audio recorder! Current feature include;
- MP3 file output
- Sends files to downloads directory in os system
- Labels the files with the date and time produced
- Button press start
- Button press end
- Cross platform (should be)

Further features to implement;
- Simplify the code with a class system (mainly so that I can practice coding classes)
- Start frontend actual interface (I've never done that before, how exciting)
